script for backup Your logbook from Things.app (GTD app for Macintosh)

Terminal:
  $ ruby logbook.rb

Clean Your logbook in Things.app     #after that Your Iphone Sync gonna be faster.

Now You can research logbook_backup.html file in Spotlight. Just like it was still in Your Things.app, but bigger, faster, stronger ;]
